This means that an IIR filter has feedback, and the output signal can oscillate or ring due to the feedback. IIR filters are characterized by their transfer function, which is a ratio of polynomials of the filter's input and output signals.\n","\n","IIR filters are used in a variety of signal processing applications, including audio and image processing, biomedical signal processing, and control systems. Compared to Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, IIR filters typically have a lower computational cost and can achieve sharper cutoff frequencies.\n","\n","There are several methods for designing IIR filters, including **Butterworth**, Chebyshev, and elliptic filter designs. These designs differ in their passband ripple, stopband attenuation, and transition band characteristics. The choice of filter design depends on the specific application requirements."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vwbYvKnXGuyw"},"source":["# Filter performance parameters\n","Passband ripple, stopband attenuation, and transition band characteristics are important parameters that define the performance of a filter. These parameters are typically specified in the filter design process to meet specific requirements for a given application. Here is a brief overview of these characteristics:\n","\n","**Passband ripple** refers to the amount of variation in gain that is allowed in the passband of the filter. For example, a low-pass filter with a passband ripple of 1 dB would allow the gain to vary by up to 1 dB across the passband. Passband ripple is typically specified as a maximum value in decibels (dB).\n","\n","**Stopband attenuation** refers to the amount of attenuation (reduction in gain) that is required in the stopband of the filter. For example, a low-pass filter with a stopband attenuation of 60 dB would reduce the gain by at least 60 dB in the stopband. Stopband attenuation is typically specified as a minimum value in decibels (dB).\n","\n","**Transition band** refers to the frequency range between the passband and stopband of the filter. In this region, the gain of the filter changes from the passband to the stopband. The width of the transition band is typically specified as the frequency range over which the gain changes from the passband ripple to the stopband attenuation. The steepness of the transition is also an important characteristic and is typically specified as the rate of attenuation per octave or per decade.\n","\n","These characteristics are interrelated, and changing one can affect the others. For example, increasing the passband ripple can allow for a steeper roll-off in the stopband, but may also increase the width of the transition band. The choice of filter type and design parameters depends on the specific requirements of the application."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HO-6WP0SGT98"},"source":["# IIR filter design methods\n","Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic filters are all types of IIR filters, which means they have feedback loops in their design. These filters have different characteristics and are useful for different applications.\n","\n","**Butterworth filters** are designed to have a maximally flat frequency response in the passband. This means that the gain in the passband is as uniform as possible. The trade-off for this flatness is a slower roll-off (i.e., less steep attenuation in the stopband). Butterworth filters are often used in applications where a flat response is desired, such as in audio applications.\n","\n","**Chebyshev filters** are designed to have a steeper roll-off in the stopband than Butterworth filters. This means that they can achieve a higher level of attenuation in the stopband for a given order of filter. The trade-off for this steeper roll-off is some ripple (i.e., variation) in the passband. Chebyshev filters can be designed as Type I or Type II, with Type I filters having ripple only in the passband and Type II filters having ripple only in the stopband.\n","\n","**Elliptic filters** are designed to have the steepest possible roll-off in the transition region between the passband and stopband, for a given order of filter. This means that they can achieve a high level of attenuation in the stopband with minimal ripple in the passband. However, they also have ripple in both the passband and stopband, which can make them more difficult to design and tune.\n","\n","In summary, Butterworth filters are often used when a flat response is desired, Chebyshev filters are useful when a steeper roll-off is needed, and elliptic filters are used when a very steep roll-off is required with minimal ripple. The choice of filter type depends on the specific requirements of the application."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qd1n8NXeHxYI"},"source":["# **Low Pass Butterworth IIR filter**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T-PWis5pEkRN"},"source":["In this example, we first specify the filter parameters, including the sample rate `fs`, the cutoff frequency `cutoff`, and the filter order `order`.
