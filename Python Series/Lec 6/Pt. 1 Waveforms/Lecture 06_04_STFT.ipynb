The result is a **2D map** (time × frequency) that shows *when* different frequency components occur.\n","\n","## What is STFT used for?\n","STFT is used whenever you care about **both**:\n","- **Which frequencies are present** and\n","- **When they occur**\n","\n","Common practical use-cases:\n","- Transient detection (bursts, impacts, crack/AE events, tool chatter)\n","- Process monitoring (regime changes, instabilities, anomalies)\n","- Speech/music analysis (phonemes, onsets, timbre)\n","- Diagnostics in rotating machinery (fault harmonics appearing intermittently)\n","- Any signal with **time-varying spectral content**\n","\n","## Why plain FFT is often insufficient (the disadvantage)\n","The FFT assumes you’re analyzing a **stationary** signal over the whole record. It returns a spectrum that is an **average over time**:\n","- If a 350 Hz tone appears only briefly, the FFT shows *it exists*, but not **when** it happened.\n","- If the signal changes from 100 Hz to a chirp, the FFT blends it into a single global summary.\n","\n","So: **FFT is great for “what frequencies exist overall,” but it cannot tell “when they happen.”**  \n","That missing time information is exactly what STFT restores.\n","\n","## The STFT equation\n","A common discrete-time STFT definition is:\n","\n","$$\n","X(m,\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n]\\; w[n-m]\\; e^{-j\\omega n}\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $x[n]$ is the signal\n","- $w[\\cdot]$ is the window function (e.g., Hann/Hamming)\n","- $m$ is the time index (window position / frame)\n","- $\\omega$ is angular frequency\n","\n","In plain language: **multiply by a shifted window, then FFT that chunk**.\n","\n","## Why window size is *the* main knob\n","Window size controls the classic trade-off:\n","\n","- **Short window** → good **time resolution**, poor **frequency resolution**  \n","  (events are localized in time, frequency bins look smeared / thick)\n","- **Long window** → good **frequency resolution**, poor **time resolution**  \n","  (harmonics are sharp in frequency, but events smear across time)\n","\n","Useful rules of thumb:\n","- Time resolution $\\approx$ window duration $= N_{\\text{win}}/f_s$\n","- Frequency bin spacing $\\Delta f \\approx f_s/N_{\\text{win}}$\n","\n","So window size is important because it decides what your plot will “tell the truth” about: **timing** or **spectral precision**.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"044a97a0","metadata":{"id":"044a97a0"},"source":["## Demo: effect of window size (separate plots)\n","We generate a signal with:\n","- a 100 Hz tone early\n","- a 350 Hz tone in the middle\n","- a chirp (200→700 Hz) later\n","\n","Then we compute STFT with different window sizes and show **separate 2D spectrograms** (one figure per window size) using a **shared dB color scale** so the comparison is fair.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"a80521cb","metadata":{"id":"a80521cb"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from scipy.signal import stft, get_window, chirp"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"5462494f-6266-4b8a-a45d-39db6d8bf3c7","metadata":{"id":"5462494f-6266-4b8a-a45d-39db6d8bf3c7"},"outputs":[],"source":["# -----------------------------\n","# 1) Make a signal with time-varying frequency content\n","# -----------------------------\n","fs = 2000  # Hz\n","T = 2.0    # seconds\n","t = np.arange(int(T * fs)) / fs\n","\n","x1 = (t < 0.8) * np.sin(2*np.pi*100*t)  # 100 Hz early\n","x2 = ((t >= 0.8) & (t < 1.3)) * 0.9*np.sin(2*np.pi*350*t)  # 350 Hz mid\n","x3 = (t >= 1.3) * 0.8*chirp(t, f0=200, f1=700, t1=T, method=\"linear\")  # chirp late\n","\n","rng = np.random.default_rng(0)\n","x = x1 + x2 + x3 + 0.05*rng.standard_normal(len(t))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"772e57cf-b5fd-4637-a33f-071398442c3c","metadata":{"id":"772e57cf-b5fd-4637-a33f-071398442c3c"},"outputs":[],"source":["# -----------------------------\n","# 2) Helper to compute STFT (single call)\n","# -----------------------------\n","def compute_stft_db(x, fs, nperseg, overlap_ratio=0.75, window_type=\"hann\"):\n","    noverlap = int(overlap_ratio * nperseg)\n","    win = get_window(window_type, nperseg, fftbins=True)\n","    f, tt, Zxx = stft(\n","        x, fs=fs, window=win,\n","        nperseg=nperseg, noverlap=noverlap,\n","        nfft=nperseg, boundary=None, padded=False\n","    )\n","    S_db = 20*np.log10(np.abs(Zxx) + 1e-12)\n","    return f, tt, S_db"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b0475bab-0e97-4c92-acfd-fd11f3865a66","metadata":{"id":"b0475bab-0e97-4c92-acfd-fd11f3865a66"},"outputs":[],"source":["# -----------------------------\n","# 3) Compute STFTs (for shared color scaling)\n","# -----------------------------\n","f64,  tt64,  S64  = compute_stft_db(x, fs, nperseg=64)\n","f256, tt256, S256 = compute_stft_db(x, fs, nperseg=256)\n","f1024, tt1024, S1024 = compute_stft_db(x, fs, nperseg=1024)\n","\n","all_db = np.hstack([S64.ravel(), S256.ravel(), S1024.ravel()])\n","vmax = np.percentile(all_db, 99)\n","vmin = vmax - 60  # show 60 dB range"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bfdc49b0-f69c-46ca-adde-f0bd27371b96","metadata":{"id":"bfdc49b0-f69c-46ca-adde-f0bd27371b96"},"outputs":[],"source":["# ============================================================\n","# PLOT 1: window = 64\n","# ============================================================\n","plt.figure(figsize=(9, 4.5), dpi=150)\n","im = plt.pcolormesh(tt64, f64, S64, shading=\"auto\", vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\n","plt.title(f\"STFT Spectrogram | window=64 samples (~{64/fs*1000:.1f} ms), overlap=75%\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"Time (s)\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Frequency (Hz)\")\n","plt.ylim(0, fs/2)\n","plt.axvline(0.8, linestyle=\"--\", linewidth=1)\n","plt.axvline(1.3, linestyle=\"--\", linewidth=1)\n","cbar = plt.colorbar(im);
