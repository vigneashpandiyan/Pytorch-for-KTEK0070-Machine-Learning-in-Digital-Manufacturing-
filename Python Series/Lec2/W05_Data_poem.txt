Eternal Echo by Perplexity AI 

In countless dreams, your face appears to me,
Through misty veils of time, both near and far.
Our hearts entwine like roots beneath the sea,
Unbroken waves that chase the morning star.

From ancient whispers carried on the breeze,
Your laughter calls across the endless night.
In every form, through every shifting seas,
We find our way back into shared delight.

The world may turn, the seasons fade and flee,
Yet love remains, a flame that softly glows.
No storm can dim what souls have come to be,
In tender rhythms only silence knows.

We've danced through joys and sorrows hand in hand,
Renewed in every breath, in every glance.
No end awaits upon this timeless strand,
Our story writes itself in love's expanse.

Forever bound, in light and shadow's play,
Your essence fills the void where others stray.
Through lives untold, we'll meet along the way,
Eternal echo, never to decay.
